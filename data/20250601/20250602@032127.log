03:21:28 Initializing AcquireSupport V8.1.1
03:21:28 Telescope is ACP->MaxPoint-ASCOM Remote Client 1 REMOTE DRIVER: TCS772.DFM.ASCOM.Telescope, driver V3
03:21:29 Dome is MaxDome
03:21:29 *1* Telescope and Dome connected OK. Can Telescope can upark?
03:21:29 *2* Yes. Can connect to MaxIm Camera?
03:21:30 *3* Yes. Can abort any active exposures? 
03:21:30 *4* Yes. Setup camera download preferences
03:21:30 *5* Successful. Can turn off camera subframes?
03:21:30 *6* Can read MaxIm version and Imager name?
03:21:30 MaxIm DL is version 6.50
03:21:30 Imager is Apogee USB/Net
03:21:30 *7* Can discover and setup filterwheel?
03:21:30 Using focus offsets and star mags from FilterInfo.txt
03:21:30 Selecting filter z from previous ACP run at 20250601@113315 UTC
03:21:30 *8* Yes filterwheel discovered and configured
03:21:30 Imager readout modes:
03:21:30   0 is Monochrome
03:21:30   1 is Monochrome (Preflash)
03:21:30 Autoguiding is disabled
03:21:30 (assuring that FocusMax is running now...)
03:21:35 Calculated unbinned plate scales (arcsec/pix): H = 0.67 V = 0.67
03:21:35 Calculated field of view (arcmin): H = 11.5 V = 11.5
03:21:35 Plate solving With A2.0 (best for pointing)
03:21:35 Mount supports tracking rate offsets
03:21:35 This is AcquireImages V8.1.0
03:21:35 Compiling plan...
03:21:36 (using ACP Plan Compiler V8.1.0)
03:21:36 ...plan OK!
03:21:36 This plan has 1 live target(s), 10 images
03:21:36 There are 5.0 min. of actual imaging time
03:21:36 Image file set-numbers start with 1
