04:06:06 Initializing AcquireSupport V8.1.1
04:06:06 Telescope is ACP->MaxPoint-ASCOM Remote Client 1 REMOTE DRIVER: TCS772.DFM.ASCOM.Telescope, driver V3
04:06:06 Dome is MaxDome
04:06:06 *1* Telescope and Dome connected OK. Can Telescope can upark?
04:06:06 *2* Yes. Can connect to MaxIm Camera?
04:06:08 *3* Yes. Can abort any active exposures? 
04:06:08 *4* Yes. Setup camera download preferences
04:06:08 *5* Successful. Can turn off camera subframes?
04:06:08 *6* Can read MaxIm version and Imager name?
04:06:08 MaxIm DL is version 6.50
04:06:08 Imager is Apogee USB/Net
04:06:08 *7* Can discover and setup filterwheel?
04:06:08 Using focus offsets and star mags from FilterInfo.txt
04:06:08 Selecting filter z from previous ACP run at 20250602@033906 UTC
