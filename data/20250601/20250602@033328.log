03:33:29 Initializing AcquireSupport V8.1.1
03:33:29 Telescope is ACP->MaxPoint-ASCOM Remote Client 1 REMOTE DRIVER: TCS772.DFM.ASCOM.Telescope, driver V3
03:33:29 Dome is MaxDome
03:33:29 *1* Telescope and Dome connected OK. Can Telescope can upark?
03:33:29 *2* Yes. Can connect to MaxIm Camera?
03:33:30 *3* Yes. Can abort any active exposures? 
03:33:30 *4* Yes. Setup camera download preferences
03:33:30 *5* Successful. Can turn off camera subframes?
03:33:30 *6* Can read MaxIm version and Imager name?
03:33:30 MaxIm DL is version 6.50
03:33:30 Imager is Apogee USB/Net
03:33:30 *7* Can discover and setup filterwheel?
03:33:30 Using focus offsets and star mags from FilterInfo.txt
03:33:30 Selecting filter z from previous ACP run at 20250601@113315 UTC
03:33:30 *8* Yes filterwheel discovered and configured
03:33:30 Imager readout modes:
03:33:30   0 is Monochrome
03:33:30   1 is Monochrome (Preflash)
