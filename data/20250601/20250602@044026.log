04:40:27 Initializing AcquireSupport V8.1.1
04:40:27 Telescope is ACP->MaxPoint-ASCOM Remote Client 1 REMOTE DRIVER: TCS772.DFM.ASCOM.Telescope, driver V3
04:40:27 Dome is MaxDome
04:40:27 *1* Telescope and Dome connected OK. Can Telescope can upark?
04:40:27 *2* Yes. Can connect to MaxIm Camera?
04:40:28 *3* Yes. Can abort any active exposures? 
04:40:28 *4* Yes. Setup camera download preferences
04:40:28 *5* Successful. Can turn off camera subframes?
04:40:28 *6* Can read MaxIm version and Imager name?
04:40:28 MaxIm DL is version 6.50
04:40:28 Imager is Apogee USB/Net
04:40:28 *7* Can discover and setup filterwheel?
04:40:28 Using focus offsets and star mags from FilterInfo.txt
04:40:28 Selecting filter z from previous ACP run at 20250602@041012 UTC
04:40:28 *8* Yes filterwheel discovered and configured
04:40:28 Imager readout modes:
04:40:28   0 is Monochrome
04:40:28   1 is Monochrome (Preflash)
04:40:28 Autoguiding is disabled

04:40:33 Calculated unbinned plate scales (arcsec/pix): H = 0.67 V = 0.67
04:40:33 Calculated field of view (arcmin): H = 11.5 V = 11.5
04:40:33 Plate solving With A2.0 (best for pointing)
04:40:33 Mount supports tracking rate offsets
04:40:33 This is AcquireImages V8.1.0

04:40:34 ...plan OK!
04:40:34 This plan has 1 live target(s), 60 images
04:40:34 There are 60.0 min. of actual imaging time
04:40:34 Image file set-numbers start with 1
04:40:34 Periodic auto focus every 30 min.
04:40:34 (includes a plan-start auto focus)
